# Kelz-Mask-Class
This repository contains the code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to detect whether a person is wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly, or not at all. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and the data is preprocessed to extract masked faces using YOLO annotations.
